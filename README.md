Iris is a flower which has three different species namely Setosa,Verginica and Versicolor.I took Iris dataset which has 150 rows describing features of iris flower and to which species does it belongs to.
Using Clustering algorithm,I grouped dataset into three cateroies based on features and target values.
I built a model in which we can get the name of the species or which species does the flower belongs to just by entering features of a iris flower.
